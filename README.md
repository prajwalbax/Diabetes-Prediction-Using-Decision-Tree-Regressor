This project implements a diabetes prediction model using the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn and a Decision Tree Regressor.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn. It contains ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements for 442 diabetes patients. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

## Model

We used a Decision Tree Regressor from scikit-learn to predict diabetes progression. Decision trees are versatile machine learning algorithms that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

## Implementation

The main steps of the implementation include:

1. Loading the diabetes dataset
2. Preprocessing the data
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets
4. Creating and training the Decision Tree Regressor model
5. Making predictions on the test set
6. Evaluating the model's performance
